I have been recently trying out opengl to understand how games work and 
how to write a small game engine hopefully. [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) 
is a great learning resource for learning how to render things with opengl 
and gradually works through to advance topics including model, shaders and lighting.

> Note: If you are trying to make a 2D game, raylib is another great C library which has a 
lot of abstractions and utilities to draw basic shapes and model.
